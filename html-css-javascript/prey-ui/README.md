# Prerequisites
You need a browser that supports CSS3 and allows dynamically loading content from `file:///`. On my system, the only working browser is the most recent Firefox.

You can see it inside your browser [here](https://sigalor.github.io/lookwhaticando/html-css-javascript/prey-ui/lockscreen.html).

# Background
[On YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NRnnKxyphA), I saw a preview for [Prey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prey_(2017_video_game)). I really liked the user interface of the computers in this game, so I decided to test my web design skills and try to redesign it by myself using modern techniques like CSS3 and jQuery.
